Code in this directory is used to process the data generated by scCAT-seq, C1 CAGE, BAT-seq, etc. 

First, `Fastq` file is needed and the output file format is `BED`. Each Row represents read in corresponding position. Then `BED` file as input is needed to call peak using `CAGEr` R package.

Second, peaks are called by `CAGEr` R package and corrected by our algorithm. Each Row represents a peak.


Here is the scCAT-seq 5' data and 3' data processing workflow. To see detail imformation of other data processing, please see `C1_CAGE_5_data_processing.sh`, `C1_STRT_5_data_processing.sh`, `Arguel_et_al_5_data_processing.sh` and `BAT-seq_3_data_processing.sh`.


We have uploaded test data and scripts . Reader can download at [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ycaGaMpVfE6LxUJRoySOfr2Gd50J2Qen).



# 1. Preparation

In this workflow, we assume that the genome fa file is located in `~/index/mm10/mm10.fa`. Genome annotation file is located in `~/index/mm10/gencode.vM18.annotation.gtf`. STAR index is located in `~/index/mm10_STAR/`. fastq files from scCAT-seq are located in `~/fastq/`.

STAR index must be prepared before running this workflow. For build index, you can run:

```
## you can change fa and gtf file path
STAR --runThreadN 24 --runMode genomeGenerate \
--genomeDir ~/index/mm10_STAR/ \
--genomeFastaFiles ~/index/mm10/mm10.fa \
--sjdbGTFfile ~/index/mm10/gencode.vM18.annotation.gtf \
--sjdbOverhang 150
```

# 2. Convert to bed

We use `convert_to_bed.sh` to process the data. The script usage is:

```
sh convert_to_bed.sh <genome fa file> <STAR index> <fastq file dir> <output dir>
```

For example:
```
sh convert_to_bed.sh ~/index/mm10/mm10.fa ~/index/mm10_STAR/ ~/fastq/ ~/scCAT_seq/
```

Output files are stored in `~/scCAT_seq/five_pirme/final_out` and `~/scCAT_seq/three_pirme/final_out`. `*remove_trRNA.bed` are needed for downstream analysis. Its format is:

```
chr1    3214161 3214286 ST-E00126:647:HL57HCCXY:1:2107:20354:17377      255     -

```

This is a tab-delimited file. Each row represents a read.




# 3. Call peak and features generation

In this step, we only consider peaks on chr 3 for simplification.

Features for peak correction are listed below:

1) TPM_of_peak: The total Tags per Million(TPM) value of the peak called by `CAGEr`.
2) TPM_of_Dominant_Site: The highest TPM value of all sites within a peak.
3) Gene_length: The length of the transcript annotated.
4) Peak_width: The width of the peak called by `CAGEr`.
5) Dominant_TPM_to_Smart2: The ratio of Dominant_TPM to the RPM value of the corresponding gene revealed by Smart-seq2.
6) Slope_smart2_curve: The slope of Smart-seq2 coverage curve around the peaks.
7) Trend_of_smart2_reads: Calculated by dividing the number of reads increased/decreased within 50bp distance by 50.
8) Percentage: The percentage of read counts of a peak to the total counts of a transcript.
9) Motif: Motif information around TSS/TES peak


We use `callpeak_correction_TSS.sh` and `callpeak_correction_TES.sh` to generate features and compare peaks to `Gencode`, `FANTOM5` and `PolyA_DB` databases. The script usage is:

```
sh callpeak_correction_TSS.sh <bed file> <Smart-seq2 readcount> <Smart-seq2 wig file> <FANTOM5 file>
sh callpeak_correction_TES.sh <bed file> <Smart-seq2 readcount> <Smart-seq2 wig file> <PolyA_db file>
```

For example:

```
sh callpeak_correction_TSS.sh ~/scCAT_seq/five_pirme/final_out/O41_72_TKD180302275-N704-AK417_AHL57HCCXY_L1_2.fq_with_tag.fq.trimed.remainGGG_Aligned.out.sam_extract_uniquely_map.sam_extractmismatch_add_header_sorted_remove_trRNA.bed O_merge_standard_smart_seq2.count O_merge_standard_smart_seq2_sorted_chr3.wig tc_ovary.bed

```

`*final.csv` are ouput files. The 5' output file format is:

This is a comma-delimited file. Each row represents a peak.



# 4. Peaks correction




`*final.csv` generated in step 3 are input files.




We use `ml.py` to process the data. The script usage is:

```
For ERCC data:
python ml.py -t /path/to/train_data -e /path/to/test_data 
For genome data:
python ml.py -e /path/to/test_data 
```

For example:

```
python ml.py -e tc_O41_72_5cap_final.csv
python ml.py -e tc_O41_72_3tail_final.csv
```

This is a comma-delimited file. Each row represents a peak.

The last col is the prediction of each individual peaks in the input file. The value `1` indicates a true TSS/TES peak while value `0` indicates a false TSS/TES peak.
