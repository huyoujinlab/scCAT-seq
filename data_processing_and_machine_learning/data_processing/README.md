# Code for data processing and peak calling
Code in this directory is used to process the data generated by scCAT-seq, C1 CAGE, BAT-seq, etc. Fastq file is needed and the output file format is "BED". Each Row represents read in corresponding position.

Then BED file as input is needed to call peak using CAGEr R package.

The workflow of data of scCAT-seq 5', C1 CAGE, C1 STRT, Arguel et al. are similar:
1) find reads with TSO primer: Reads with TSO primer sequence at 5' are considered to further processing.
2) trim TSO primer but retain GGG:
