# Demo for call peak and correction


#### Here is a demo to call peak and correction. We extract the reads on chr 3 for simplification. The code takes in the results of bed file generated by scCAT-seq data and wig file generated by Smart-seq2 data, spits out a csv file contains 9 features and prediction:



* Features:
1) TPM_of_peak: The total Tags per Million(TPM) value of the peak called by CAGEr.
2) TPM_of_Dominant_Site: The highest TPM value of all sites within a peak.
3) Gene_length: The length of the transcript annotated.
4) Peak_width: The width of the peak called by CAGEr.
5) Dominant_TPM_to_Smart2: The ratio of Dominant_TPM to the RPM value of the corresponding gene revealed by Smart-seq2.
6) Slope_smart2_curve: The slope of Smart-seq2 coverage curve around the peaks.
7) Trend_of_smart2_reads: Calculated by dividing the number of reads increased/decreased within 50bp distance by 50.
8) Percentage: The percentage of read counts of a peak to the total counts of a transcript.
9) Motif: Motif information around TSS/TES peak

* Prediction:  
1) Predicted each individual peaks in the input file. The value "1" indicates a true TSS/TES peak while value "0" indicates a false TSS/TES peak

## 1. Call peak

```
cd call_peak
Rscript CAGE_dominant.R

for i in `ls|grep "_dominant_tes.bed"`
do
        bedtools intersect -s -a ${i} -b gencode_mm10_all_gene_genebody_and_downstream2k.bed -wa -wb > ${i%%.*}_genebody_downstream2k.bed
done

for i in `ls|grep "_dominant_tss.bed"`
do 
        bedtools intersect -s -a ${i} -b gencode_mm10_all_gene_ustream2k_and_genebody.bed -wa -wb > ${i%%.*}_upstream2k_and_genebody.bed
done 
```

"D44_52_3tail_dominant_tes.bed" and "D44_52_5cap_dominant_tss.bed" file will be generated. These file is peak calling output.



## 2. Calculate TPM_of_peak, TPM_of_Dominant_Site, Peak_width and Dominant_TPM_to_Smart2

```
Rscript cal_slope_cattss.R D44_52_5cap_dominant_tss_upstream2k_and_genebody.bed D_merge_standard_smart_seq2.count
Rscript cal_slope_cattes.R D44_52_3tail_dominant_tes_genebody_downstream2k.bed D_merge_standard_smart_seq2.count
```

"tc_D44_52_5cap_peak.csv" and "tc_D44_52_3tail_peak.csv" will be generated. In this step, we added some features for machine learning.



## 3. Calculate TPM_of_peak, TPM_of_Dominant_Site and Peak_width

```
Rscript cal_slope_cattss2.R tc_D44_52_5cap_peak.csv D_merge_standard_smart_seq2_sorted_chr3.wig
Rscript cal_slope_cattes2.R tc_D44_52_3tail_peak.csv  D_merge_standard_smart_seq2_sorted_chr3.wig
```

"tc_D44_52_5cap_peak.csvnew.csv" and "tc_D44_52_3tail_peak.csvnew.csv" will be generated. In this step, we calculate the slope of Smart-seq2 coverage curve around the peaks.



## 4. Change feature name

```
Rscript cal_slope_cattss3.R tc_D44_52_5cap_peak.csvnew.csv
Rscript cal_slope_cattes3.R tc_D44_52_3tail_peak.csvnew.csv
```

"tc_D44_52_5cap_peak.csvnew.csv.csv" and "tc_D44_52_3tail_peak.csvnew.csv.csv" will be generated. In this step, features were added and we can define the TRUE or FALSE of each peak.


## 5. Add motif information

In this step, mm10.fa genome file is needed. 

```
#### Find TATA-box, BREu, BREd around TSS.
python find_motif_re_TSS_version2.py /BIGDATA1/gzzoc_yjhu_3/index/mm10_chr/mm10.fa tc_D44_52_5cap_peak.csvnew.csv.csv tc_D44_52_5cap_peak_final.csv

#### Find polyA singal around TES.
python find_motif_re_TES.py /BIGDATA1/gzzoc_yjhu_3/index/mm10_chr/mm10.fa tc_D44_52_3tail_peak.csvnew.csv.csv tc_D44_52_3tail_peak_final.csv
```

## 6. Prediction and correction

```
mv tc_D44_52_5cap_peak_final.csv ../data/
mv tc_D44_52_3tail_peak_final.csv ../data/
cd ../
python ./bin/demo.py
```

The new folder named "output" will be built after completion of the pipeline, which contains all the output files, including the "\*.csv" file. 

The last column in the .CSV files shows the predicted classification corresponding to each individual peaks in the input file. The value "1" indicates a true TSS/TES peak while value "0" indicates a false TSS/TES peak.


* From step 1 to step 6, it takes about 15 minutes.
